# *[Alpha]* Animal Crossing Story Mode *[Replit]*
##### Animal Crossing - Replit v. and Story/Game mode included!
--- 

## Preview:
#### This program is Animal Crossing, similar to @SilvermoonCat's [Animal Crossing](https://repl.it/talk/share/Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons/119091) ~~*sry for ping*~~. However, the difference is that mine is pretty much a story mode, but theirs is more of a game. I did add a game mode this to this though. :D This has almost 2000 lines of code, plus more in the future, as this is Alpha. I will try to keep you guys as updated as possible!
--- 

## Introduction:
#### As I know python the most out of all other programs, I chose python to make Animal Crossing. This is New Horizons and Replit v. connected. The reason why I say it is connected to replit is because:
1. I made it in replit (lol)
2. It uses some replit functions/modules

#### yeah. Anyways, I tried to make it as similar to New Horizons, so I hope you enjoy! I also added some 'pictures'/animations. I don't want to spoil *everything*, but I will tell you that I made island choosing, island naming, villagers, etc. I will tell you more in the next section. ;D

## Sections:
#### So far in this program, I have made:
* Username and ~~almost~~ saving.
* Island choosing, naming.
* Villager (i havent fully made it, like adding villagers)
* Story Mode and Game Mode
* Workshop and fishing

#### That is what I have so far. I hope you guys enjoy what I have so far!

## Credits:
#### Credits to @SilvermoonCat for the game idea (without them knowing) and moi for the code. This prob took about almost 2 weeks (alpha). xd
--- 

## Conclusion:
#### I hope you guys like this! sry i was rly inactive on talk, i was working on this, and i was pretty busy. I might post Beta a few weeks or months later. I'll keep you guys notified! Cya! ;D
